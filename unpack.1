reads a
.B "Darwin Core Archive"
.RB ( DwC-A )
file, specifically as published by
.IR Artdatabanken ,
and stores its contents as separate files,
after cleaning them up somewhat:
.
.IP \- 3x
MS-DOS line endings are removed
.PD 0
.IP \-
the dreaded UTF-8 BOM is removed
.IP \-
Timestamps are rewritten in ISO format, if necessary.
.IP \-
CSV files are sorted on Taxon/TaxonName number.
.PD

The cleanup is intended to make it easier to use the data, to integrate updates,
and to keep it under version control in a meaningful way using e.g.
.BR git (1).
The CSV sorting, for example, eliminates useless
rearrangement of lines between versions.
(Such rearrangement does happen, at the time of this writing.)
.\" Perhaps they just dump a hash table to file.

The timestamp problem appeared in
.B  Reference.csv
in early 2025, and may be a temporary glitch. The main reason I normalize it is,
as with the ordering, to avoid useless differences between versions.

A Darwin Core Archive is a ZIP file. Reading it from stdin means you can let e.g.
.BR curl (1)
download it, without necessarily storing the ZIP file itself on disk.
