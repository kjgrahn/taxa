SLU Artdatabanken publishes "Dyntaxa – svensk taxonomisk databas" [1].
That's taxon lists for organisms in Sweden, along with vernacular
names and so on. People in Sweden generally accept this taxonomy.

The data used to be published as Excel sheets, but since 2024 it's
published in Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) format.

What's in this repo is two things:

A.  A utility for unpacking a DwC-A archive and cleaning it up, making
    it suitable for tracking and sharing in a Git archive.

B.  Such an unpacked DwC-A for Dyntaxa, updated now and then.
    This lets you follow the changes made by Artdatabanken, go
    back in time and compare, and so on.

In 2018, this same repo used to contain a similar thing, but based on
the now obsolete Excel sheets. All of that work was hard and
problematic in many ways, and never got used.
