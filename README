SLU Artdatabanken publishes "Dyntaxa – svensk taxonomisk databas" [1].
That's taxon lists for organisms in Sweden, along with vernacular
names and so on. People in Sweden generally accept this taxonomy, and
access it through a web interface called Artfakta.

The data used to be published as Excel sheets, but since 2024 it's
published in Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) format.

What's in this repo is three things:

A.  A utility for unpacking a DwC-A archive and cleaning it up, making
    it suitable for tracking and sharing in a Git archive.

B.  Such an unpacked DwC-A for Dyntaxa, updated now and then.
    This lets you follow the changes made by Artdatabanken, go
    back in time and compare, and so on.

C.  A utility taxa(1) for producing flat taxon lists from the Dyntaxa
    data. These are suitable for use with programs which needs taxon
    lists, like gavia[2] and groblad[3].

This is a less-than-ideal mix of tools and other people's data.
I might split it at some point.

The software is C++ and a Makefile, and should build on any Unix with
minor adjustments, if you install libarchive first.

In 2018, this same repo used to contain a similar thing, but based on
the now obsolete Excel sheets. All of that work was hard and
problematic in many ways, and never got used.
